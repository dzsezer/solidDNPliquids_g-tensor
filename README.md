# solidDNPliquid_g-tensor

This is a supplementary repository for the manuscript "The solid effect of dynamic nuclear polarization in liquids II: Accounting for g-tensor anisotropy at high magntic fields" (https://doi.org/10.5194/mr-2023-10). The provided files generate the figures in the manuscript. If needed, please contact Deniz Sezer for explanations.

The included files are as follows:

1. utils_funs.py: Contains helper functions
2. utils_classes.py: Defines the classes and the methods on the objects
3. utils_plots.py: Uses the above functions to generate plots
4. main.py: Calls the plotting functions to make the figures

The analyzed EPR and DNP spectra of 10- and 16-Doxyl-PC in DOPC lipid bilayers are in the directory 'data'.

The generated plots are in the directory 'pdfs'.
